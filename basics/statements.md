# Statements and the structure of the program

## What is a statment?

- A statement is a type of instruction that causes the program to perform some action 

- A statement can be a single line of code or a block of code enclosed in curly brackets, but in c++, not all of them end in semicolons

- A statement can be a function call, an assignment, a control flow statement, a jump statement
  
- A statement can be a declaration, an expression, a return statement


## Types of statements
- **Declaration statements**: declaration statement is a statement that introduces a new identifier (e.g., a variable, function, or class) into the program. It specifies the type and name of the identifier, and may also initialize it with a value
  
    ```cpp
    int x;  // declares an integer variable x
    double y = 3.14;  // declares a double variable y and initializes it to 3.14
    ```
- **Jump statements**: 
- **Expression statements**: 
- **Compound statements**: 
- **Selection statements** (conditionals): 
- **Iteration statements** (loops): 
- **Try blocks**:
