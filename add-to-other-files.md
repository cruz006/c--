# Variables and Data Types

* int: integer (e.g. int x = 5;)
  
* double: floating-point number (e.g. double y = 3.14;)
  
* char: single character (e.g. char c = 'a';)
  
* bool: boolean value (e.g. bool isAdmin = true;)
  
*string: string of characters (e.g. string name = "John";)
Operators

## Arithmetic Operators

* "+" (addition)
  
* "-" (subtraction)
  
* "*" (multiplication) / / (division) % % (modulus)
  
## Comparison Operators
* "==" (equal to)
  
* "!=" (not equal to)
  
* ">" (greater than)
  
* "<" (less than)
  
* ">=" (greater than or equal to)
  
* "<=" (less than or equal to)
  
## Logical Operators
* && (and)
* || (or) ! (not)

### Assignment Operators
* = (assignment)
  
* += (addition assignment)
  
* -= (subtraction assignment)
  
* *= (multiplication assignment)
  
* /= (division assignment)

## Control Structures

### Conditional Statements
- if statement: if (condition) { code to execute }
  
- if-else statement: if (condition) { code to execute } else { code to execute }
  
### Loops
- for loop: for (init; condition; increment) { code to execute }
  
- while loop: while (condition) { code to execute }
do-while loop: do { code to execute } 

- while (condition);
  
### Jump Statements
- break: exit a loop or switch statement
  
- continue: skip to the next iteration of a loop
  
- return: exit a function and return a value 
  
## Functions

- Function Declaration: return-type function-name(parameters) { code to execute }
  
- Function Call: function-name(arguments)
   
## Arrays and Vectors

- Arrays Declaration: data-type array-name[size];
  
- Indexing: array-name[index]
  
- Vectors Declaration: vector<data-type> vector-name;
  
## Operations:
- push_back(): add an element to the end of the vector

- size(): get the number of elements in the vector

- at(): access an element at a specific index


## Input/Output
- cin: input stream (e.g. cin >> variable;)
  
- cout: output stream (e.g. cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;)
  
- endl: newline character
  

## Other

- #include: include a header file (e.g. #include <iostream>)
using namespace std;: use the standard namespace
main(): the entry point of the program
